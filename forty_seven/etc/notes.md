## Extended techniques
-   Quarter tones
-   Harmonics
-   Multiphonics
-   Key clicks
-   Flutter tounge

## How to choose which extended techniques to use?

## How to make extended techniques survive through quantisation?
Abjad allows arbitrarily large pitch number, therefore it is possible to encode
extended techniques with pitch number such as 1000,1001, etc., and "attaching"
it to a normal pitch so that they would form a chord, which will survive
through quantisation. Then all we have to do is to search for these abnormal
pitch, and decoding them back to extended techniques.
